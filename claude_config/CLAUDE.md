## Subagent Model Selection

When spawning subagents via the Agent tool, use `model: "sonnet"` for routine tasks like:
- Codebase exploration and search
- File reading and summarization
- Running tests or builds
- Simple code generation or edits

Reserve the default (Opus) for tasks requiring deep reasoning, complex architecture decisions, or multi-step problem solving.
